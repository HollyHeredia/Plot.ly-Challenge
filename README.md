# Plot.ly-Challenge
This repo houses my plot.ly homework for data bootcamp.

In this challenge, we were tasked to create a web-based dashboard for a scientific dataset concerning bellybuttons. Included in this dashboard:

* I used D3 and HTML to read samples.json

* A horizontal barchart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in an individual

* A bubblechart.

* A guage chart.

* A Demographic Info box displaying other relevant info regarding the indivudal selected.

Hope you enjoy!
